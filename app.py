It's great that you're using the NCERT book â€“ it's a solid resource. \n\nSince you're in Class 12, I'm assuming you have a good grasp of basic integration rules and maybe even some substitution. Integration by parts is usually introduced around this time. \n\nLet's break it down a bit:\n\n1. **The Formula:** Remember the integration by parts formula (often remembered as **ILATE**  or **LIATE** to choose the 'u' function, which we'll discuss next):\n\n   **âˆ«u dv = uv - âˆ«v du**\n\n2. **Choosing 'u' and 'dv':** This is often the trickiest part. You need to choose which part of your integral will be 'u' (which you'll differentiate) and which part will be 'dv' (which you'll integrate).  \n\n   * **ILATE/LIATE:** This is a helpful acronym for choosing 'u':\n      * **I**nverse trigonometric functions (e.g., arctan x)\n      * **L**ogarithmic functions (e.g., ln x)\n      * **A**lgebraic functions (e.g., xÂ², x + 1)\n      * **T**rigonometric functions (e.g., sin x, cos x)\n      * **E**xponential functions (e.g., e^x)\n\n     Choose 'u' from the function type that comes earlier in ILATE.\n\n3. **Finding 'du' and 'v':**\n   * **Differentiate** 'u' to find 'du'.\n   * **Integrate** 'dv' to find 'v'.\n\n4. **Plug into the Formula:** Substitute 'u', 'v', 'du', and 'dv' into the integration by parts formula.\n\n5. **Solve the Remaining Integral:** Often, the integral on the right side of the formula (âˆ«v du) will be simpler to solve than the original integral.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say you want to integrate: âˆ« x * cos(x) dx\n\n* **Choosing 'u' and 'dv':**\n    * According to ILATE, algebraic functions (x) come before trigonometric functions (cos x). \n    * So:  u = x  and  dv = cos(x) dx \n* **Finding 'du' and 'v':**\n    * du = dx\n    * v = âˆ« cos(x) dx = sin(x)\n* **Plug into the Formula:**\n    * âˆ« x * cos(x) dx = x * sin(x) - âˆ« sin(x) dx\n* **Solve the Remaining Integral:**\n    * âˆ« x * cos(x) dx = x * sin(x) + cos(x) + C \n\n**Practice Makes Perfect!**\n\nNow, can you share an example problem from your NCERT book that you're finding difficult?  We can work through it together step-by-step. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions along the way! ðŸ˜Š \n"]},
